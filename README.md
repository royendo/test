# Welcome to the Rill Tutorial Project!

With a lot of different features and possibilities within Rill, we wanted to create a tutorial to allow you to follow along, have examples to reference, and see the different capabilities of Rill!

Each folder follows a specific course in our [Tutorials](https://docs.rilldata.com/tutorials).

## Folders

1. Rill Basics - Follows our Rill Basics Course
2. Rill Advanced - Follows our Rill Advanced Course
3. Rill and ClickHouse - Follows our Rill and ClickHouse Course
4. Administration - Has objects used specifically in our Administration Course
5. HowTos - Divided into subfolders for each How To found on our Tutorials page.
